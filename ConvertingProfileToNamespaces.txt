Refactoring a Module for Namespaces
December 7, 2013

OVERVIEW
Read all of these notes before beginning. Especially the final points about the upgrade process. 


NOTES: Someone had already partially converted Dizkus, so the templates and other assets had been moved to /Resources
and the controller actions had already been suffixed with 'Action'


STEP ONE:
run module:restructure from inside the module directory
php ../../../Tools.git/zikula-tools module:restructure --vendor=Zikula --module-name=ProfileModule --dir=. --force

notes: 
1. is —module-name and not —module also name should include 'Module' like 'ProfileModule' not just 'Profile'
2. auto-commits via git


STEP TWO:
run module:ns from inside the module directory
php ../../../Tools.git/zikula-tools module:ns --dir=. --vendor=Zikula --module-name=ProfileModule

notes: 
1. use —module-name also
2. use “ProfileModule” not “Profile”
3. not auto committed


STEP THREE
(no need to run module:controller_actions on Profile as it had already been done)


CLEAN UP STEPS (manual work):
1. look for instances where the import (use) statements have been placed above the namespace and move below
2. look for root level classnames (e.g. Profile_Constant) and convert them to slash-names
2a. look for and refactor Helper or Listener classnames and convert to slash-names
3. look for legacy Zikula classes (e.g. Zikula_Event) and place forward-slash before (e.g. \Zikula_Event) or add imports.
4. convert string versions of classnames (in quotes like 'Profile_Entity_Property') to slash-names
    ('Zikula\Module\ProfileModule\Entity\PropertyEntity')
5. you can now use shortcut entity names: `'ZikulaProfileModule:PropertyEntity'` instead of
    `'Zikula\Module\ProfileModule\Entity\PropertyEntity'` when used as a string in entityManager searches (but **not** in
    the SchemaTool (e.g. `DoctrineHelper::createSchema()`)
6. reformat arrays and class method chains
7. correct use of module name throughout: 'Profile' to 'ZikulaProfileModule'
  - recommend using `$this->name` in php files that extend from Zikula_AbstractBase and `$module` in templates.
  - in other places, consider using a constant instead
  - convert modvar keys (from $modvars.Profile.foo to $modvars.$module.foo)
  - convert name usage in permission checks
8. consider places in the DB that might be storing the original module name and write upgrade routine to compensate
9. consider permissions module DB changes
10. add old module name ('Profile') to 'oldnames' array in Version


UPGRADE
At this time, it is unclear how the core is handling an upgrade from Widget to AcmeWidgetModule. There are issues with
persistent events being called on the old classname and also if the module will recognize itself in order to upgrade.

For the moment, you should uninstall the module completely before making any of these conversions and then reinstall
once everything is done.
